 This is basic methodology behind what we seek to achieve here.
A Problem of the Modern Day: "The speed of communications is wondrous to behold. It is also true that speed can multiply the distribution of information that we know to be untrue." - Edward R. Murrow

The problem with journalism today is that it is biased and promulgates a certain world view. People and institutions hold these world views because they think that they are an accurate representation of the world and these world views give an ideological tint to everything they see. It is ok to have a theory of how the world works, simplified or otherwise just like with the scientific method: one make observations and develops a theory to explain these observations. Unfortunately, this is where most stop where the scientific method continues. In the scientific method, one uses their theory to generate a prediction from the same principles used to explain the initial observations. One then tests these predictions and, in the words of richard feynman, if the data doesn't agree you're WRONG. How can one apply this to poltical beliefs, theories and world views. If communism explains the world accurately, can it be used to explain what will happen next, do nazis have good insights on house prices? Well we propose that it is with the methodology laid out above.

The predictors with the best scores we assume have the required knowledge and insights of the world to accurately explain why things will happen and why the world is the way it is and what are the key trends to look out for in the future.
